                        <p id='about-head1' className='about-text'>The Kids being Kids Organization was founded by two dedicated students from Western University, Ben Lambert and Adam Cohen, 
                            who share a common goal of giving back to their community. Recognizing the tremendous impact that sports can have on a child's life, 
                            they firmly believe that every child should have the opportunity to experience the joy, camaraderie, 
                            and personal growth that come with participating in sports, regardless of their economic circumstances.</p>
                        <p id='about-head1' className='about-text'>Motivated by their own experiences and the support they received from their community, Ben and Adam decided to harness the power of their local 
                            community and extend the same opportunities to the next generation of athletes. 
                            They rallied their community members, including fellow students, families, and local businesses, to join their cause.</p>
